## Addition

The javacsript for generate this random password works during test by monitoring the Chrome devTool, however I believe there are something that I couldn't figure it out in the given function writePassword(), since the above variable password works but the value cannot be assigned to variable passwordText. I am not sure how to fix this at this moment.
